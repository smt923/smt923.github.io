        <h2 id="aboutme">About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Jake, otherwise known as 'smt, and I'm a programmer (and a bunch of other stuff) from England. I've been using some sort of computer for as long as I remember and programming for the last 6 or so years.</p>
          <p>I have a wide range of interests and hobbies when I'm not programming, these include things from gaming, esports and infosec to music, playing the guitar, shortwave radio and photography.</p>
          
          <b>My work & stuff I've done:</b>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/smt923">Github</a></b> - Published many small-medium open source projects, contributed documentation and small changes to projects like Rust and Unreal Engine 4 as well as many libraries across many languages. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://ldjam.com/users/smt/games">Ludum Dare</a></b> - Helped plan, design and develop small games for the Ludum Dare game jam, using Unity and C# and working to an incredibly tight deadline in a small remote team, our team dynamic
            has been pretty fluid though I took up a lot of the programming work, often helped by the rest of the team.
          </p>

          <b>Languages I've used the most:</b>
          <p>C#, Go, Python, Rust, Lua, a little Javascript, Haskell and Elixir</p>
          
          <b>Stuff I have experience with:</b>
          <p>A broad range of utilities and command line applications, web scraping & task automation, Unity3D, simple emulators, interpreters & compilers, backend web development, RESTful APIs, Elasticsearch/Kibana, Docker, Cloud hosting providers, Linux server setup & management</p>
          
          <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
          <p>In my spare time I enjoy taking on small to medium programming projects, often making utilities for friends or myself, or spending my time researching and learning about things such as emulation or creating interpreters for simple toy languages.</p>
          <p>This is a short list of some of the projects from my Github, as well as small games for various game jams:</p>

                to the project even though it's basically obsolete.
